* Add important information to your viz, and maximize screen real estate, with viz in tooltip. 
Highlight trends over time, provide a different level of detail—even include multiple vizzes—in just one tooltip.

* In the tooltip editor, select the sheet you want to embed from the Insert menu. 
You can also customize the size and filter actions for your viz in tooltip.
